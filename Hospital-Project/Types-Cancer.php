          The most common cancers in children are (childhood) leukemia (32%), brain tumors (18%), and lymphomas (11%) . In 2005, 4.1 of every 100,000 young people under 20 years of age in the U.S. were diagnosed with leukemia, and 0.8 per 100,000 died from it . The number of new cases was highest among the 1–4 age group, but the number of deaths was highest among the 10–14 age group . In 2005, 2.9 of every 100,000 people 0–19 years of age were found to have cancer of the brain or central nervous system, and 0.7 per 100,000 died from it . These cancers were found most often in children between 1 and 4 years of age, but the most deaths occurred among those aged 5–9 . The main subtypes of brain and central nervous system tumors in children are: astrocytoma, brain stem glioma, craniopharyngioma, desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma, ependymoma, high-grade glioma, medulloblastoma and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor.
